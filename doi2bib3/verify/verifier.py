"""The verification engine: decide whether a BibTeX entry is authentic.

A verdict is reached purely by code, from corroborating evidence:

* whether the DOI / arXiv identifier resolves at all (CrossRef, and the
  registry-agnostic DOI Handle System);
* how well the registered title matches the entry's title;
* whether the authors and year corroborate.

A reference is only ``verified`` when authoritative data backs it up, and a
hard verdict (``not_found`` / ``mismatch``) is only reached when two
independent signals agree. Anything uncertain is surfaced as ``review`` or
``unverified`` rather than guessed at.
